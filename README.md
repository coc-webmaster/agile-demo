## Project Objective

This project is a functional, interactive business intelligence portfolio designed to demonstrate the core competencies required for the Senior Business Intelligence Analyst role at Agile Space Industries.

This portfolio contains three distinct dashboards, each tailored to a specific audience:

* **Executive Summary:** A high-level, at-a-glance view of the entire project portfolio's financial health, designed for senior leadership.
* **Program Manager Deep Dive:** An interactive tool for program managers to analyze the performance, cost, and budget of their specific projects.
* **Finance & Operations View:** A detailed dashboard for finance and operations teams to track company-wide spending trends and detailed project profitability.

## Technology Stack
